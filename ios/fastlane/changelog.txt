Welcome to update number five! This is a small update that fixes two important bugs.

1. When exporting rotated content, sometimes it would show up distorted in the exported video. That issue is now fixed! You'd be shocked at just how...many....weeks...this bug took. I probably would've shipped this app a month ago if I hadn't been stuck on that...
2. When sharing to social networks, it would sometimes prompt you to delete the photo from your Camera Roll. Now it just doesn't do that.
