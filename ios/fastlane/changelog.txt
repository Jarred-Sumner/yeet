Welcome to update number four!

New share page:
- After you post, it now lets you share directly to other social networks
- It lets you save too.

Thread titles are now automatic. If you write anything in a post for a new thread, it will show up at the top.

Performance:
- Sped up exporting and uploading video & images a lot! Now the maximum scale for images/video is @1.5x screen size, instead of full retina.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a crash that can occur when tapping the Plus button
- Fixed missing images in Recent section for some videos/gifs
- Fixed an issue where it would say that uploading a new post errored when it actually didn't.
